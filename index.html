                at their office in Princeton, New Jearsy. In the Summer of 2023

            <li>Analyzed and visualized extensive client data utilizing Python, leading to improved client service communication and a permanent enhancement of the company team page, making it easier for reps to answer dividend related client queries quickly and accurately. </li>
            <li>Utilized Python analysis to pinpoint trends, enabling the formulation of proposals for refining internal tool workflows. Subsequently, executed backend code enhancements, directly contributing to an impactful 33% surge in tool usage.</li>
